									<h2>About me</h2>
									<p>Hi! My name is Jasmine, and I am a sophomore at Virginia Tech double majoring in Multimedia Journalism and Criminology.
									In my free time, I like to watch netflix, bake, and hang out with my friends.</p>
									<p>Ever since my photojournalism courses in high school, my interested in photography has been piqued. I enjoy taking photos of genuine, candid moments where people
								seem to be having the most fun and in their natural elements. I also love capturing nature in its most beautiful moments.
								 This gallery is a compilation of candid moments, the beautiful nature around Blacksburg and Halloween decorations. </p>
